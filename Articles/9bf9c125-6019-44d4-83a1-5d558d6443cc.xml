All applications which perform authentication or use a third-party authentication module.

=Description
A lockout policy is used during authentication to prevent attackers from attempting a large number of passwords on a given account. However, this security mechanism can be used by an attacker to cause a denial of service condition. If the attacker can exhaust the invalid login attempt limit for a given account, that account may be locked out against the owner's wishes.

This attack is especially powerful if the attacker can guess a large number of usernames or account numbers for a scripted attack on many users.]]></Data>
