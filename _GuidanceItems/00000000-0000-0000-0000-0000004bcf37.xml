    <Data><![CDATA[==Description==

Data leaks between sessions occur when unintentional access to one session's data is provided to another session. Data leaks between sessions usually occur when session-specific data is stored in member variables of singleton object and objects from a shared pool. The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker may be able to access other users' data. This vulnerability affects all Java Web applications, especially ones that use Servlets. To prevent this vulnerability, avoid storing session-specific data in shared objects and ensure proper thread safety for HttpSession object access.

==Impact==

A data leak between sessions vulnerability allows an attacker to access other user's data. The exact impact depends on what information exactly is leaking between sessions, but generally speaking the attack is limited to accessing the leaking information.

==Countermeasures==

Avoid storing session-specific data in shared objects:

Ensure proper thread safety for HttpSession object access:

* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000052525d|Ensure Proper Thread Safety for HttpSession Object Access]]

==Checklists==

Session-specific data is not stored in shared objects:

* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000003cb5b4|Session-specific Data Is Not Stored in Shared Objects]]

Proper thread safety of HttpSession object access is assured:
